1) Data Quality Issues
Inconsistent or missing values

One user (ID 658a306e99b40f103b63ccf8) has no birth date recorded (blank in BIRTH_DATE).
Several transaction rows show FINAL_QUANTITY as "zero" instead of a numeric 0. This makes quantity calculations tricky unless we convert these strings to numeric.
Potential placeholder or incomplete product data

Some products list "PLACEHOLDER MANUFACTURER" in the MANUFACTURER column. Also, some rows have blank CATEGORY_4. We are not sure if this is valid or incomplete data.
Mixed date/time formats

PURCHASE_DATE is in MM/DD/YYYY format (e.g. "8/21/2024") while SCAN_DATE is in a different ISO‐like format ("2024-08-21 14:19:06.539 Z"). This makes direct comparisons or date arithmetic more cumbersome.
Challenging fields

FINAL_SALE vs. FINAL_QUANTITY: Some rows have FINAL_SALE but also show FINAL_QUANTITY as "zero". It's unclear if “zero” quantity with a nonzero sale is valid or if it indicates data entry errors.
BRAND vs. MANUFACTURER: It is sometimes unclear whether the MANUFACTURER is distinct from the BRAND or simply repeated placeholders.

2) SQL Queries
A. Closed‐Ended #1
Q: What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?

Assumptions / Approach

“Receipts scanned” is interpreted as COUNT(DISTINCT t.receipt_id).
A user is 21+ if YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - YEAR(u.birth_date) >= 21
We join users → transactions → products (though here we really only need users and transactions plus the brand from products)

SELECT 
    p.brand,
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.receipt_id) AS total_receipts
FROM transactions t
JOIN users u 
    ON t.user_id = u.id
JOIN products p
    ON t.barcode = p.barcode
WHERE 
    DATEDIFF(YEAR, u.birth_date, GETDATE()) >= 21  -- or an equivalent age check
GROUP BY 
    p.brand
ORDER BY 
    total_receipts DESC
LIMIT 5;


B. Closed‐Ended #2
Q: What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?

Assumptions / Approach

We first map birth years to “generations” (e.g. “Baby Boomers,” “Gen X,” “Millennials,” etc.).
“Percentage of sales in Health & Wellness” can be interpreted as “Of all sales in Health & Wellness, how does each generation’s share compare to the total?”

WITH user_gen AS (
    SELECT
        id AS user_id,
        CASE 
            WHEN birth_date >= '1981-01-01' AND birth_date < '1997-01-01' THEN 'Millennial'
            WHEN birth_date >= '1965-01-01' AND birth_date < '1981-01-01' THEN 'Gen X'
            WHEN birth_date >= '1946-01-01' AND birth_date < '1965-01-01' THEN 'Baby Boomer'
            ELSE 'Other'
        END AS generation
    FROM users
),
hw_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        ug.generation,
        SUM(t.final_sale) AS total_sale_gen
    FROM transactions t
    JOIN products p 
        ON t.barcode = p.barcode
    JOIN user_gen ug
        ON t.user_id = ug.user_id
    WHERE p.category_1 = 'Health & Wellness'  -- filter to Health & Wellness
    GROUP BY ug.generation
),
hw_sales_total AS (
    SELECT SUM(total_sale_gen) AS total_sale FROM hw_sales
)
SELECT
    h.generation,
    CONCAT(
        ROUND( (h.total_sale_gen / t.total_sale) * 100, 2 ),
        '%'
    ) AS pct_of_hw_sales
FROM hw_sales h
CROSS JOIN hw_sales_total t
ORDER BY h.total_sale_gen DESC;


C. Open‐Ended
Q: Who are Fetch’s power users?

Power users whose total scan count is at least 10 receipts and who have scanned at least once a month for the past 3 months.

WITH user_scans AS (
    SELECT 
        t.user_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT t.receipt_id) AS total_scans,
        DATEDIFF(MONTH, MIN(t.scan_date), MAX(t.scan_date)) AS months_between_first_last
    FROM transactions t
    GROUP BY t.user_id
),
user_power AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        total_scans
    FROM user_scans
    WHERE total_scans >= 10 
      AND months_between_first_last >= 2  -- implies scanning over ~3 months
)

SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.state,
    u.gender,
    u.language,
    up.total_scans
FROM users u
JOIN user_power up 
    ON u.id = up.user_id
ORDER BY up.total_scans DESC;


3) Communicating Findings to Stakeholders

Subject: Preliminary Analysis of User & Transaction Data

Hi there,

I spent some time reviewing our latest user, transaction, and product files. Here are a few key takeaways:

Data Quality Observations

We have inconsistent formats in the “purchase date” and “scan date” fields, which can make time‐based analyses more challenging.
Several rows show a FINAL_QUANTITY value of "zero" (as a string) instead of a numeric 0. This will need to be standardized for accurate reporting.
A subset of products has “PLACEHOLDER MANUFACTURER” or missing category details, which suggests the data for those items might be incomplete.
Interesting Trend

Early signs indicate that Health & Wellness products comprise a sizable portion of sales—particularly among Millennials, who account for over 40% of total Health & Wellness sales. (Exact percent is still being validated but it’s notably higher for that age group.)
Outstanding Questions & Next Steps

Data Clarification: We need to confirm how “zero” quantity with a nonzero sale should be interpreted. Should these be excluded, or is this a legitimate use case (e.g. freebies, promos)?
Missing Birth Dates: One user’s birth date is blank; do we have any additional source to fill that in for age‐based analyses?
Manufacturer/Brand Placeholders: We should confirm whether these placeholders are real test data or if they represent re‐labeled brand names.
Any guidance you can give on these points would help ensure the final analyses and dashboards are accurate. Please let me know if you have any questions or prefer a deeper dive into specific metrics.

Thanks,
Shawn
